    <h1>Development Roadmap</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>1. Known Issues/Bugs Prioritized for Fix</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Settler Units:</strong> Settlers currently run into the
          vertical boundary and flounder on the top row. This will be fixed so
          that if a settler reaches the far vertical boundary, it de-spawns and
          refunds the full cost.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Troop Tower Interaction:</strong> Troops currently march into
          the enemy tower to deal damage. The plan is to revise this so that
          troops remain at the grid boundary and attack the edge of the tower
          tile.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heavy Unit Armor Display:</strong> Heavy unit armor is
          visually bugged. Although the armor is mitigating damage (up to 1+50%
          of damage, capped at 100 points), the visual display isn’t working
          properly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strategem Sound Effects:</strong> Strategems currently lack
          working sound effects.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Prioritized Features/Enhancements/Quality of Life</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Audio Enhancements:</strong> Implement sound effects for the
          landing page and menu along with royalty-free music for both the menu
          and the main game.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tactics Points (TP) Adjustment:</strong> Modify TP generation
          to be based on the value of enemy troops slain, reducing incentives
          for spamming troops solely for TP.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Settings Options:</strong> Add more settings options,
          including toggling music on/off and the ability to set custom
          keybinds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional Units:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>The Sentinel:</strong> A powerful ranged unit that marches
              only vertically, patrolling a fixed rank until pushed or provoked.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Brute:</strong> A tanky melee troop with a
              medium-damage attack capable of hitting multiple enemies at once.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Greek Fire:</strong> A slow-moving, fragile unit that
              shoots liquid fire to ignite terrain and enemy troops, dealing
              strong damage over time for a brief period.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trebuchet:</strong> An immobile siege machine designed for
              long-range attacks with splash damage and a stun effect on
              affected troops, balanced by a long activation time and inability
              to attack at short range.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Additional Strategems:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Necromancy:</strong> With a long startup and high cost,
              this strategem will resurrect any troop that dies within its
              radius as a skeleton.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tower Archer:</strong> The first tower unit—a modified
              archer that can be placed on a tower tile, featuring high range,
              low damage, and a high fire rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tower Ballista:</strong> A heavy counterpart to the Tower
              Archer, offering medium range, high damage, and a lower fire rate
              with a slightly shorter lifespan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Garrison's Salvo:</strong> Target three plus-shaped areas
              on the map for barrages from your private guard. After a short
              delay, arrows rain down on all units within these areas, dealing
              heavy damage regardless of allegiance.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Campaign/Story Mode:</strong> Develop a campaign mode that
          introduces the basics of play and expands on the world of Strategrid,
          with progressive unit unlocks and evolving AI challenges.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. On the Roadmap...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Play vs Computer:</strong> Custom matches against an AI with
          selectable difficulty.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>New Maps:</strong> Expand beyond the standard grid with varied
          and larger maps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Menu Overhaul:</strong> A complete redesign of the main menu
          for improved navigation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In-Game UI/UX Upgrade:</strong> Enhance the in-game user
          interface and overall user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Online PvP Alpha Launch:</strong> Roll out an alpha version of
          online multiplayer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Superhard Mode:</strong> Introduce a challenging mode where an
          adaptive AI learns and counters your strategies.
        </li>
      </ul>
