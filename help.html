    <h1>How to Play</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Strategrid is a turn-based strategy game where two players compete on a
        12x14 grid. Each player starts with a tower on opposite edges, and the
        goal is to reduce your opponent’s tower HP to 0. In addition to spawning
        a variety of troops, you now have access to powerful
        <strong>Strategems</strong>—special abilities that can turn the tide of
        battle.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Phase System</h2>
      <p>The game alternates between two phases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Planning Phase (20s):</strong>
          During this phase, you can spawn troops and deploy strategems. Use
          your available RP and TP to plan your moves carefully. You may also
          press the “Enter” key or click “Skip Turn” to end your planning early.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Battle Phase (5s):</strong>
          Your troops automatically move and engage the enemy. Any deployed
          strategems also activate, affecting the battlefield for a limited
          duration. After the battle phase, resources regenerate for the next
          planning phase.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <p>You manage two main resources:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>RP (Resource Points):</strong>
          Used to spawn troops. RP is generated based on the number of tiles you
          control.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>TP (Territory Points):</strong>
          Used to activate strategems. TP increases as you deploy more troops
          and control more territory.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Spawning Troops</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Click the “Spawn [Troop]” button for your player.</li>
        <li>
          Hover over a valid tile that you control; a preview (or “specter”) of
          the troop will appear.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have enough RP, the troop will be spawned after its activation
          time. Each unit has different stats and abilities.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Strategems</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of constructing buildings, you now have access to powerful
        strategems. During your planning phase, click one of the Strategem
        buttons to activate a special ability:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Heal (Cost 2 TP):</strong>
          Deploy this strategem on a target tile to heal nearby friendly troops
          gradually.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Divine Wind (Cost 1 TP):</strong>
          Choose a row area (4 rows in height) to unleash a gust that pushes
          enemy troops back.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bolt Storm (Cost 3 TP):</strong>
          Select a 4x4 area where repeated strikes damage enemy units.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After selecting a strategem, click on a valid tile to place it. The
        strategem will then execute automatically during the battle phase.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Combat & Victory</h2>
      <p>
        In the battle phase, your troops and any deployed strategems come into
        play. Troops move toward the enemy side, engaging enemy units
        automatically when in range. If no enemy units block them, they continue
        advancing toward the enemy tower. Reduce the opponent’s tower HP to 0 to
        claim victory!
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Balanced Forces:</strong> Combine different troop types with
          strategems for offense and defense.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Resource Management:</strong> Keep an eye on both RP and TP.
          Save enough RP to spawn troops and enough TP to launch game-changing
          strategems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Timing is Everything:</strong> Strategems have activation
          times and durations. Plan ahead and deploy them where they can have
          maximum impact.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Territory Control:</strong> Capturing more tiles not only
          provides additional RP but also increases your strategic options.
        </li>
      </ul>
