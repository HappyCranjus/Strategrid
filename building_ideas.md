## Recommended Priority Additions

### High Priority (Fill Critical Gaps)

1. **Barracks** - Forward spawn points are essential for aggressive play
2. **Healing Shrine** - Support buildings are underrepresented
3. **Supply Depot** - Alternative TP generation creates strategic options

### Medium Priority (Add Depth)

4. **Fortress** - Heavy defensive option for turtling strategies
5. **Artillery Battery** - Long-range area damage fills offensive gap
6. **Scout Tower** - Information advantage is valuable

### Lower Priority (Nice to Have)

7. **Armory** - Interesting mechanic but less essential
8. **Teleporter** - Complex mechanic, requires careful implementation
9. **Bunker** - Garrison mechanics need additional code
10. **Resource Vault** - Economic depth but less exciting
11. **Mana Well** - Interesting but similar to Supply Depot
12. **Command Center** - Expensive multi-purpose building

## Implementation Notes

- Buildings should integrate with existing systems (deck system, RL system, etc.)
- Consider balance implications with current unit roster
- Some buildings may require new game mechanics (garrison, teleportation, etc.)
- Visual feedback is important for player understanding
- Activation times should match building importance
